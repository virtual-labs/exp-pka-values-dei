        <h2>Understanding the Acid Dissociation Constant (pKa) and Its Significance</h2>
        <p>The acid dissociation constant (Ka) quantifies the extent to which an acid (HA) dissociates into its conjugate base (A⁻) and a proton (H⁺) in solution.</p>

        <p>Because Ka values can span many orders of magnitude, it is common to express acid strength as pKa, where:</p>

        <p>A lower pKa indicates a stronger acid (more dissociation), while a higher pKa corresponds to a weaker acid. Understanding pKa is crucial because it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Helps predict the degree of ionization at a given pH.</li>
            <li>Determines the behavior of acids in biological systems and buffer solutions.</li>
            <li>Affects the solubility, reactivity, and overall chemical properties of molecules.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Performing a Titration Experiment and Monitoring pH Changes</h2>
    <p>Titration is an analytical method in which a solution of known concentration (the titrant, typically a strong base like NaOH) is gradually added to a solution containing the analyte (the weak acid) until the reaction reaches completion. During the titration, the pH of the solution is measured continuously or at set intervals. The pH changes reflect the gradual neutralization of the acid by the base.</p>
    Key points includes:
    <ul>
        <li>At the beginning, the solution is acidic.</li>
        <li>As the titrant is added, the acid is neutralized, and the pH gradually rises.</li>
        <li>Near the equivalence point, the pH changes sharply.</li>
        <li>Monitoring these changes allows the construction of a titration curve.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Plotting a Titration Curve and Determining the Buffering Region</h2>
    <p>A titration curve is a graphical representation of the pH of the solution versus the volume of titrant added. The curve typically shows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A gradual pH change in the initial region where the acid predominates.</li>
        <li>A relatively flat region (buffering region) where the solution resists rapid changes in pH due to the presence of both the weak acid and its conjugate base.</li>
        <li>A sharp rise in pH at the equivalence point, where most of the acid has been neutralized.</li>
        <li>A leveling off in pH after the equivalence point, where excess base determines the pH.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The buffering region is critical because it represents the range in which the acid and its conjugate base coexist appreciably. At the midpoint of this region (half-equivalence point), the concentration of the acid equals that of its conjugate base, and the pH equals the pKa of the acid.</p>

<h2>Calculating the pKa Value Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation</h2>
<p>The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation relates the pH of a solution to the pKa and the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base and the undissociated acid:</p>

<p>This relationship allows for a straightforward determination of pKa from the titration data by identifying the pH at the half-equivalence point.</p>

<h2>Interpreting the Titration Curve and Comparing Experimental Results with Theoretical Expectations</h2>

<h3>Interpreting the titration curve involves analyzing the shape and key features of the curve:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Initial Region: Reflects the starting pH of the acid solution.</li>
    <li>Buffering Region: Indicates the capacity of the solution to resist pH changes; its midpoint gives the pKa value.</li>
    <li>Equivalence Point: The point at which the number of moles of titrant equals the number of moles of acid present.</li>
    <li>Post-Equivalence Region: Shows the pH determined by the excess titrant.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Comparing experimental data with theoretical expectations:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Validates the method used to determine pKa.</li>
    <li>Reveals potential deviations due to experimental errors (e.g., pH meter calibration, titrant concentration inaccuracies, or temperature variations).</li>
    <li>Provides insight into the acid’s behavior in solution and confirms the reliability of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation under the given experimental conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These theoretical explanations underpin the experimental objectives and help explain how titration data is used to determine the pKa value of a weak acid and assess its acid-base properties.</p>
<p>The pKa value of an acid is a key parameter that describes its strength in solution. It is determined using a titration experiment, where a weak acid is titrated with a strong base, and pH changes are monitored. The pKa corresponds to the pH at the midpoint of the buffering region in the titration curve, where half of the acid has been neutralized.</p>
