    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare a 0.1M solution of the weak acid.</li>
        <li>Standardize a 0.1M NaOH solution.</li>
        <li>Fill a burette with NaOH.</li>
        <li>Place the acid solution in a beaker and insert a pH electrode.</li>
        <li>Add NaOH in small increments while stirring and record the pH.</li>
        <li>Continue adding NaOH until the pH remains stable.</li>
        <li>Plot pH vs. volume of NaOH added.</li>
        <li>Identify the equivalence point and determine the pKa values using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.</li>
    </ol>
